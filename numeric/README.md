This is tedious to read but please go through all the examples, there's a lots of them and they all highlight real issues.

Recommended reading order:

* floatBasic.nim
* float.nim
* intBasic.nim
* int.nim
* uint.nim
* intUint.nim

Tested with Nim 0.13.0 on Windows/MingW64 and OS X 10.11.3/clang (see the test output files).
